                    <div class="black_lifes_matter">
                        Black Lives Matter (BLM) is a decentralized political and social movement
                         protesting against incidents of police brutality and all racially motivated 
                         violence against black people. While there are specific organizations such as 
                         the Black Lives Matter Global Network that label themselves simply as "Black 
                         Lives Matter", the Black Lives Matter movement comprises a broad array of 
                         people and organizations. The slogan "Black Lives Matter" itself remains 
                         untrademarked by any group. The broader movement and its related organizations 
                         typically advocate against police violence toward black people as well as for 
                         various other policy changes considered to be related to black liberation. 
                        In July 2013, the movement began with the use of the hashtag #BlackLivesMatter
                         on social media after the acquittal of George Zimmerman in the shooting death 
                         of African-American teen Trayvon Martin 17 months earlier in February 2012. The
                          movement became nationally recognized for street demonstrations following 
                          the 2014 deaths of two African Americans, that of Michael Brown—resulting in
                           protests and unrest in Ferguson, Missouri, a city near St. Louis—and Eric Garner 
                           in New York City. Since the Ferguson protests, participants in the movement have
                            demonstrated against the deaths of numerous other African Americans by police actions 
                            or while in police custody. In the summer of 2015, Black Lives Matter activists became
                             involved in the 2016 United States presidential election. The originators of the hashtag
                              and call to action, Alicia Garza, Patrisse Cullors, and Opal Tometi, expanded their project
                              o a national network of over 30 local chapters between 2014 and 2016. The overall Black Lives
                               Matter movement is a decentralized network of activists with no formal hierarchy. 
                        The movement returned to national headlines and gained further international attention during
                         the global George Floyd protests in 2020 following the murder of George Floyd by Minneapolis 
                         police officer Derek Chauvin. An estimated 15 million to 26 million people participated in the
                          2020 Black Lives Matter protests in the United States, making it one of the largest movements 
                          in the country's history. The movement comprises many views and a broad array of demands but 
                          they center on criminal justice reform.
