                         more than half. This is because reporting by police departments is voluntary and
                         many departments fail to do so Black Americans are shot at a disproportionate rate.

                modern slavery or neo-slavery, refers to institutional slavery that continues to occur
                in present-day society. Estimates of the number of slaves today range from around 38 million
                to 46 million,depending on the method used to form the estimate and the definition of slavery being 
                used.The estimated number of slaves is debated, as there is no universally agreed definition of modern slavery;
                those in slavery are often difficult to identify, and adequate statistics are often not available. The International 
                Labour Organization estimates that, by their definitions, over 40 million people are in some form of slavery today. 
                24.9 million people are in forced labor, of whom 16 million people are exploited in the private sector such as domestic work,
                construction or agriculture; 4.8 million persons in forced sexual exploitation,
                and 4 million persons in forced labor imposed by state authorities. 15.4 million people are in forced marriage.

                    Slavery took place almost everywhere in the world,
                     and it was implemented and enforced by Europeans for 
                     centuries. This has been a hindrance to the progression 
                     of African people economically.
                     Apartheid policies of systematic racial discrimination and 
                     segregation had a deep and enduring influence on inequality 
                     in South Africa. But inequality predated apartheid,
                      and the core components of its distributional 
                      regime predated the system itself. By 1948, 
                      the state had developed a set of policies concerning
                       welfare, the labour market, and the growth path that 
                       structured patterns of inequality. State polices shaped 
                       the massive social and economic changes in South African 
                       societies.<p></p>

                <div class="second_sub_header">
                    The U.S. economy on the other hand  was built on the 
                    exploitation and occupational segregation of people of color.
                     many government policies and institutional practices helped 
                     create this system, the legacies of slavery, Jim Crow, and the 
                     New Deal—as well as the limited funding and scope of anti-discrimination
                      agencies—are some of the biggest contributors to inequality in America.
                       Together, these policy decisions concentrated workers of color in 
                       chronically undervalued occupations, institutionalized racial disparities 
                       in wages and benefits, and perpetuated employment discrimination. 
                       As a result, stark and persistent racial disparities exist in jobs, 
                       wages, benefits, and almost every other measure of economic well-being.
